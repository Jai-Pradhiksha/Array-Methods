  <h1>Array Methods Examples</h1>

  <h2>forEach:</h2>
  <p>Open the console to see the names:</p>
  <script>
    const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"];
    names.forEach(function(name) {
      console.log(name);
    });
  </script>

  <h2>map:</h2>
  <p>Open the console to see the modified departments:</p>
  <script>
    const departments = ["IT Department", "ECE Department", "Mechanical Department"];
    const modifiedDepartments = departments.map(function(department) {
      return department + " - Saveetha";
    });
    console.log(modifiedDepartments);
  </script>

  <h2>filter:</h2>
  <p>Open the console to see the list of adults:</p>
  <script>
    let age1 = [25, 16, 32, 19, 14, 22];
    const adults = age1.filter(function(age) {
      return age > 18;
    });
    console.log(adults);
  </script>

  <h2>reduce:</h2>
  <p>Open the console to see the sum and average:</p>
  <script>
    const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    const sum = numbers.reduce(function(accumulator, current) {
      return accumulator + current;
    }, 0);
    const average = sum / numbers.length;
    console.log("Sum:", sum);
    console.log("Average:", average);
  </script>

  <h2>every:</h2>
  <p>Open the console to see if all ages are greater than 18:</p>
  <script>
    let age2 = [25, 30, 22, 19, 20, 28];
    const allAdults = age2.every(function(age) {
      return age > 18;
    });
    console.log("Are all adults?", allAdults);
  </script>

  <h2>some:</h2>
  <p>Open the console to see if at least one person is an adult:</p>
  <script>
    let age3 = [15, 22, 30, 12, 19];
    const hasAdult = age3.some(function(age) {
      return age > 18;
    });
    console.log("Is there at least one adult?", hasAdult);
  </script>
